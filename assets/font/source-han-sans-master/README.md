# Source Han Sans

Source Han Sans is a set of OpenType/CFF Pan-CJK fonts. In addition to functional OpenType fonts, this open source project provides all of the source files that were used to build these OpenType fonts by using the AFDKO *makeotf* and *otf2otc* tools.

## Download the fonts (OTF, OTC, Super OTC, Subset OTF)

Individual font resources or ZIP files for various deployment configurations are available for download:

* [Latest release](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/tree/release)

To help decide which fonts to download, please refer to the Configurations section of the [official font readme file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/raw/release/SourceHanSansReadMe.pdf). Those who are unfamiliar with GitHub are encouraged to reference the [official Source Han download guide](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/download-guide-source-han.pdf), which is provided in English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

You can also download entire [releases](../../releases) that include all available configurations in a single ZIP file. The ZIP file for the [latest release](../../releases/latest) is approximately 2GB.

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build the binary font files from source, you need to have installed the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/) (AFDKO). The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor applications.

### Build all fonts

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the OpenType/CFF and OpenType/CFF Collection fonts. The [COMMANDS.txt](COMMANDS.txt) file provides the command lines that are used to build the OTFs and OTCs.
